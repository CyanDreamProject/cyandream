		<h2>CyanDream was created to serve a purpose - There are lots of good ROM's in this world. But most of the time we don't use half of those features.<br/>
		  CyanDream was created to only have the features we only really use, and to be stable and fast. We don't want a ROM like PAC-Man, where the whole ROMS have been merged, we just want specific features<br/>
		  So our goal is to make our perfect ROM that has all the features from each ROM that we like.</h2>
